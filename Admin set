Thanks for the update! That error—**“There is no such global user or group”**—usually means Windows couldn’t find the user account you’re trying to add. Let’s troubleshoot it step by step:

### 🧠 Common Causes & Fixes

1. **Check the Username**
   - Make sure the username is spelled exactly as it appears in `C:\Users\`.
   - If the account is Azure AD joined, use this format:
     ```cmd
     net localgroup administrators "AzureAD\Citsadmin" /add
     ```
     ➤ Note the quotes and the `AzureAD\` prefix.

2. **Local vs Domain vs Azure AD**
   - If you're on a **domain-joined** machine, you may need:
     ```cmd
     net localgroup administrators "DOMAIN\Citsadmin" /add
     ```
   - If it's a **local account**, no prefix is needed:
     ```cmd
     net user Citsadmin L0ckout!! /add
     net localgroup administrators Citsadmin /add
     ```

3. **Run CMD as Administrator**
   - Right-click Command Prompt and choose **Run as administrator**.
   - Without elevated privileges, the command may silently fail or throw misleading errors.

4. **Check for Existing Account**
   - Run:
     ```cmd
     net user
     ```
     ➤ This lists all local accounts. If **Citsadmin** isn’t listed, the account wasn’t created.

If you're still stuck, let me know:
- Is the machine Azure AD joined, domain joined, or standalone?
- Are you trying to add a local user or a cloud/domain user?

We’ll get this sorted!
